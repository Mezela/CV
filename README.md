Hello,

I am Pamela. I am a recently graduated Makers software developer.

Following an MEng in Engineering Science from Oxford University, I worked in Business Development at Lamudi (Rocket Internet) in Nigeria before working as a management consultant. 

I love building things. As a consultant, I realised that I naturally gravitated towards technical work and data analysis. I started programming in my spare time towards helping me improve the tools I built for consulting projects. I realised I loved solving logical problems using software: in particular learning new tools and how to apply them to solve a small problem, exploring new concepts through small projects, building and breaking things...


## Skills

#### Communication

- As a Consultant, I managed multiple stakeholder relationships in my projects. These relationships were across a range of business functions (e.g. HR, IT, Estates) and required consistent and clear communication.
- I have led client interviews and workshops, aiming to get the most from sometimes challenging situations e.g. restructure.

#### Building Tools

- As a Consultant, I was drawn to developing data tools for clients. I developed a data and resource model to capture previously unquantifiable user demand across large operational areas for clients. This tool provided data to drive the recommendations we made for the client and was adapted for subsequent large projects by the team.

#### Goal Driven & Curious

- I am organised and goal-driven and have frequently taken the role of Programme Manager for transformation projects. For example, I Programme Managed the integration of a newly acquired business in Asia into a FTSE 100 Insurer based in London. This included designing the system and implementation. This project was successful in achieving a 20% reduction in headcount.
- I have been learning Python and Machine Learning in my spare time, building a programme for flower recognition.
